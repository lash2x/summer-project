		<li>Poor sleep habits can increase the body’s energy needs. At night, movement and the need for calories is reduced. But when you are sleep-deprived, your brain will release chemicals to signal hunger. This can lead to eating more, exercising less, and gaining weight.</li>
		<li>Those who generally slept for less than five to seven hours a night were 12 percent more likely to experience a premature death. People who slept more than eight or nine hours per night had an even higher risk — 30 percent.</li>
		<li>people who reduced their nightly sleep time from seven to eight hours to below seven hours were at an increased risk of death from all causes. Additionally, the researchers also saw an increased risk of death from all causes in those who slept for a long amount of time per night.</li>
		<li>When you sleep, your immune system releases compounds called cytokines. Some cytokines have a protective effect on your immune system by helping it to fight inflammation, including inflammation due to infection.</li>
		<li>sleep helps protect and strengthen your memory</li>
